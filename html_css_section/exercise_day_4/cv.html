                                    Your resume should be no longer than 1-2 pages. Keep it to 1 page if you have less
                                    than 8 years of professional work experience. If you have more, you might consider
                                    using 2 pages.

                                    Include a skills section - it's incredibly important. This step will prove highly
                                    valuable if the company uses ATS (applicant tracking system).

                                    select Download, and then pdf.

                                    of the position. Keep sections that are less relevant to the job you're applying to
                                    short.

                                    Your most recent position should have the most bullet points, as long as the
                                    position is relevant to the one you're applying for.

                                    It's not enough to describe what you have done or your areas of responsibility, you
                                    need to quantify the impact of your work. Recruiters scan resumes for numbers, so
                                    quantify as much as you can.
                                </li>
                                <li>You can talk about xx% improvement your initiatives yielded.</li>

                                    Or you could mention the increase in company revenue of xx% that your work
                                    contributed to.
                                </li>

                                    Avoid writing bullet points that are longer than 2 lines. No recruiter will read
                                    bullet points that are as long as paragraphs.
                                </li>

                                    Carefully review your resume several times to eliminate any typos. Additionally,
                                    consider having someone else proofread it to prevent sending an imperfect resume.

                                    Be consistent with grammar. Generally, resumes should be written in the past tense.
                                    The exception is if you're describing your current position with ongoing
                                    responsibilities.
